## DLLLoader

DLLLoader is a C# based application that lets you inject DLL files into a process.

## Credits

I am using [Injection Files](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/c-/213037-x86-manual-map-injection.html) - these files to inject the DLL file.

## Installation

Step 1: Import the loader.sql into your database. 
Step 2: In Form2.cs change the database credentials. 
Step 3: Enter data in the database table, if you don't know your system HWID, start up the program, fill in the boxes on the first page, click the button 'Submit'. The second page will open and you will find your system HWID there.
